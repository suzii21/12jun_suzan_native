//What is OOP? List OOP concepts

OOP treat data as critical element in program development 
and does not allow it toflow freely around the system.
It ties the data more closely to the function that operates
on it.
Object Oriented Programming allows decomposition of program
into a number of entities called objects and then builds 
data and function around these
objects.

Some of the basic concepts of object oriented programming
are:
- Objects
- Classes
- Data abstraction and encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritance
- Dynamic Binding
