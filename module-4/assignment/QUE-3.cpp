//What is the difference between OOP and POP?

OOP:
OOP treats data as a critical element in the program 
development and does not allow it to flow freely around 
the system.
In OOP, the major emphasis is on data rather than procedure
It ties data more closely to the function that operate 
on it, and protects it from accidental modification from 
outside function.
C++, Java, Dot Net, Python etc are the example of Object 
oriented programming language.

Features of OOP (Object Oriented Programming):-
- Class
- Object
- Encapsulation
- Data Abstraction
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Data binding

POP:
In the procedure oriented approach, large programs are 
divided into smaller programs known as functions.
In POP, a program is written as a sequence of procedures 
or function.
In POP, each procedure contains a series of 
instructions for performing a specific task.
During the program execution each procedure an 
be called by the other procedures.
To call a procedure, we have to write function 
Examples of procedural oriented programming language are 
COBOL, FORTRAN, PASCAL, C programming language etc.
