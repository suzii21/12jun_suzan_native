//WAP to show difference between Structure and Union.

STRUCTURE:
-Each variable member occupied a unique memory space.
-Individual member can be accessed at a time.
-Several mambers of a structure can initialize at a once.
-It allows multiple variable members at once.
-It is used to store different data type values.



UNION:
-Variables members share the memory space of the largest size variable.
-Only one member can be accessed at a time.
-Only the first member of a union can be initialized.
-It allows only one variable member at once.
-It is used to store one data at a time from different data types.
