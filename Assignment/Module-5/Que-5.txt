5-What do you understand By Data Redundancy?

Data redundancy refers to the practice of keeping data in two or more 
places within a database or data storage system. Data redundancy 
ensures an organization can provide continued operations or services 
in the event something happens to its data -- for example, in the 
case of data corruption or data loss.
