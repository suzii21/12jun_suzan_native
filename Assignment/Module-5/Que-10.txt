10-What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?


A trigger is a special type of stored procedure that automatically 
runs when an event occurs in the database server. DML triggers run
when a user tries to modify data through a data manipulation 
language (DML) event. DML events are INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE 
statements on a table or view.
