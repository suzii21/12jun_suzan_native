2-What is Normalization?


Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database. It includes creating 
tables and establishing relationships between those tables according to rules designed 
both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating 
redundancy(having several copies of the same data in the database) and inconsistent dependency.
