3]What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC
->Software Development Life Cycle is known as SDLC.It is is a process that defines the various stages involved in the development of software for delivering a high-quality product.
There are six phases of SDLC:

-PLANNING
During planning all the relevant information is collected from the customer to develop an application as per their expectations after requirements are gathered part of planning is done.

-ANALYSIS

-IMPLEMENTATION
After the design is done implementation of planning and designing is strted as per the requirement of customers.There are
three types: 
  1)front-end - development of coding.
  2)Middleware: They connect both the front end and back end.
  3)Back-end: A database is created.    

-TESTING AND INTEGRATION
The whole software is tested to make sure that the requirements of cutomer is implemented or not and also to check that the software should works completely. After testing the product is available for users.

-MAINTENANCE
maintenance of the product for eg: if any issue comes up and needs to be fixed like bugs,errors,etc is to be done by developers.
They also have to update the software.


4]What is DFD?Create a DFD diagram on flipkart.
-DFD-data flow diagram 
it is use to show the flow of system's data .there are two types:
  1)0 level DFD
  2)1 level DFD
